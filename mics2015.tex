% This is sigproc-sp.tex -FILE FOR V2.6SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% OCTOBER 2002
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V2.6SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.6SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
%
%  However, both the CopyrightYear (default to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (default to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX) can still be over-ridden by whatever the author
% inserts into the source .tex file.
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2003 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\section{Introduction and Background}\label{sec:intro}
\subsection{Overview of Clojure}\label{sec:clojure}
%\emcomment{Emma - many thanks for getting things started! Below are
%  comments. The majority of them refer to making this material
  %understandable to the target audience (i.e not using terms that
  %CSci undergrads typically don't know. Otehrwise things are well
  %organized and well written.}
  
  
Clojure, developed in 2007 by Rich Hickey~\cite{Hickey:2008}, is a dynamic, functional
programming language in the Lisp family. Dynamic means that the process of solving
a problem is broken down into subparts in order to make solving easier and less complex.
\emcomment{``dynamic'' refers to ``dynamically typed''} 
%\emcomment{Use simpler, more concrete terminology: there are many ways
  %in which JVM can be utilized. Probably need to explain that the JVM
  %is Clojure interpreter, mention and explain REPL somewhere in this paragraph.}
%\emcomment{Need to explain what you mean by dynamic}
Clojure utilizes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as an interpreter, and Clojure code compiles to JVM bytecode.
It offers easy 
%\emcomment{accessibilty?} 
accessibility of Java frameworks. The Clojure REPL \emcomment{what is REPL?} is another easy way to get acquainted with Clojure.
The REPL allows users to see immediate results and respond easily and quickly. For any programmer, the use of the REPL 
is highly advised and can make programming in Clojure much simpler.
%\emcomment{This wouldn't make any sense to the target audience and is
  %not needed (perhaps with the exception of multithreading:}
%including optional type hints
%and type inference and easy multithreading options. All the while,
%Clojure remains completely dynamic.  
%\emcomment{This is a strange wording: what does it mean to ``remain''
 % in this context? And you already said it was dynamic.}

Because Clojure is a functional language, it puts strong emphasis on
immutable data types. An immutable data type means data types \emcomment{data cannot be changed, not data types} cannot
be changed, unlike %\emcomment{in? Also, why ``many'' and not all of
  %them?}
  imperative programming languages. When using
Clojure, in order to change a data type, an entirely new data item
must be made. Immutable data types help prevent side effects in the program. 
A side effect is when a function alters memory
or interacts outside of its scope instead of returning a value. Side
effects can make debugging or resolving errors or failures more
difficult. This is because when a function interacts with other
functions, when it is not supposed to, any issues in the 
code can be spread out throughout the program. The reduction of side
effects means problems with the code are easier to find and fix.
Because of this, immutable data types are practical for novice
programmers.
%\emcomment{I would first explain what side
  %effects are, and only then why they complicate things for novice
  %programmers}
 
Clojure, like other Lisp languages, uses prefix notation. This means
that function calls use parenthesis, followed by the function name,
and then any parameters: 
\begin{verbatim}
	(<function-name> <argument 1> <argument 2>)
\end{verbatim}

Even \emcomment{All functions, including built-in mathematical functions, use this form? ``Even'' implies that somehow this is unexpected.} built-in functions, such as mathematical functions, use this form:
\begin{verbatim}
	(+ 5 5)
	-> 10
\end{verbatim}

Note that \texttt{->} indicates the result of computations in the Clojure interpreter.
%\emcomment{We indicate the result of computations in Clojure
  %interpreter as \texttt{->} -- plus we need to explain REPL and
  %interpreter.}

%\emcomment{I don't think we need syntax for interop. I would comment
 %out the example for now.}
Clojure also has easy accessibility to Java functions and Java
interoperability. This means that any Java method can be called just
like normal Clojure functions.
%\begin{verbatim}
%	(.methodName object *arguments)
%\end{verbatim}

%\emcomment{Thsi is true, but probably not useful for our readers}
%As well as the use of Java methods, Clojure can also use macros, Java
%utilities, concurrency and multithreading, and even certain Java
%objects to enhance the abilities of using Clojure. 

%\emcomment{before we get into anonymous functions, we need to show how
%to define regular functions (general syntax and a couple of examples)}
When a program needs to use a single value or function, it can be helpful to define it under a variable name
so that it's easier to access throughout the program. Using the command \texttt{def} or \texttt{defn}, we
can define functions and variables:
\begin{verbatim}
	(def mystring "Hello World")
	mystring
	-> "Hello World"
\end{verbatim}

In the above example, we define a string to be \texttt{"Hello World"}. This way, whenever we call \emcomment{I would avoid ``call'' here since calling is for functions} \texttt{mystring},
it will return the string we bound to the variable name. Here is an example of using \texttt{defn}:
\begin{verbatim}
	(defn increment-number [number] (+ number 1))
	(increment-number 2)
	-> 3
\end{verbatim}

In this example, we saved a function that takes a number and increments it by adding 1 to it. In any function, the 
function name is the word after the \texttt{defn}, the pieces in the square brackets after the function name indicate 
the arguments that the function takes in, and what follows is the body, or what the function does. \emcomment{the expression returned by the function? ``does'' has imperative flavor}

Now let us say that we have a program where we want to use a function, but only once. This means that we do not
necessarily need to define it with a name because Clojure supports anonymous functions. Anonymous functions allow 
programmers to quickly make
% \emcomment{not sure what you mean by``rare'' here. Those that aren't predefined?}  
functions when needed. 
However, since these functions are not  stored, the program would not be able to use them by name more than once. 
%\emcomment{call them?} by name after the usage. 
The following example is of the same increment-number function as above, but implemented anonymously: 
\begin{verbatim}
	(fn [number] (+ number 1))
\end{verbatim}

%In anonymous functions, anything in the brackets that is following the
%\texttt{fn} is arguments. 
%\emcomment{and in regular functions as well} 
%After the arguments in \texttt{[]}, is the
%body. If the program wanted to be able to call this function multiple
%times, it would make more sense to simply put a \texttt{def} with a
%name in front: 
%\emcomment{It's not quite that: firstly, it's defn, and not def, but
 % you also need to explain where the function name is}
%\begin{verbatim}
%	(def increment-number [number] (+ number 1))
%\end{verbatim}

%Now, the program can call this function any time by using the name \texttt{increment-number}.

Clojure also has a variety of different types of data structures. All 
of Clojure's collections are immutable, which means that the data within the structures cannot be modified. 
%\emcomment{I wouldn't go into persistent, just talk about immutable.}
%This means that the data in the structures cannot be modified, and that each
%structure preserves the previous version of itself. 
The different types of structures Clojure uses are lists (denoted by \texttt{()}),
sets (denoted by \texttt{\#\{\}}), vectors (denoted by \texttt{[]}),
and hashmaps (denoted by \texttt{\{\}}). The first three types of data
structures listed can contain any number, including \texttt{nil} (Clojure's equivalent of \texttt{null} or nothing), of 
values of any type (a data structure is untyped, which means it does not care \emcomment{too informal, rephrase} if types of values in one structure
are mismatched):
%\emcomment{don't use the word ``normal'' in a research paper} data structures: 
\begin{verbatim}
	(1 2 "foo" :a 9 "bar")
\end{verbatim}

%\emcomment{I am not sure which of data structures we will actually need; we
  %never defined keywords, and I am not sure we will need those (but if
  %we do, we will need to explain them). We will definitely need
  %vectors and lists and hashmaps. Sets probably not.}

%They \emcomment{Not sure what ``they'' referes to; most structures can
%hold any amount (any number, to be more precise) of values, nil isn't
%explained, and probably needs to 
%be, but I am not sure; nil isn't an amount of anything.} can hold any
%amount, including \texttt{nil}, of values of any type 
%\emcomment{we need to mention earlier that all data structures are
 % untyped: not unique to hashmaps}
%(a data structure is untyped, which means it does not care if
%types of values in one structure as mismatched).

However, hashmaps are unique in the fact that a hashmap is a collection of key-value pairs: 
\begin{verbatim}
	{key value, key value, key value}
\end{verbatim}

A more realistic \emcomment{why ``realistic''? Just an example. What you are showing above is abstract syntax} example would look something like:
\begin{verbatim}
	{:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}
\end{verbatim}
%\emcomment{It's unclear from just the syntax what it means to be a
%  collection of key/value pairs.}

\emcomment{I would first introduce keywords and then explain that they are typcally used as keys}
In hashmaps, usually keywords, indicated by a colon in front of a
simple indicating word, are used as keys, and the value is what the
key is bound to. 
%\emcomment{keys aren't pointing to anything, they are bound to something}
In the hashmap above, the keywords are
\texttt{:a}, \texttt{:b}, and \texttt{:c}, and they are pointing to
the values \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, and \texttt{3}. 

Just like variables and values, data structures can also be bound to a
variable name: 
\begin{verbatim}
	(def myhashmap {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
	myhashmap
	-> {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}
\end{verbatim}

%This enables the data structures to be called, traversed, etc by the
%use of a single name. \emcomment{I am not sure this addds anything; an
%example would be better.}
