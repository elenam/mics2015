% This is sigproc-sp.tex -FILE FOR V2.6SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% OCTOBER 2002
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V2.6SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.6SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
%
%  However, both the CopyrightYear (default to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (default to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX) can still be over-ridden by whatever the author
% inserts into the source .tex file.
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2003 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@acm.org 
%
% For tracking purposes - this is V2.6SP - OCTOBER 2002

\subsection{Overview of Clojure}\label{sec:clojure}
Clojure, developed in 2007 by Rich Hickey, is a dynamic, functional programming language in the Lisp family. It utilizes the Java Virtual Machine, which means that it compiles to JVM bytecode, and it offers easy availability to Java frameworks, including optional type hints and type inference and easy multithreading options. All the while, Clojure remains completely dynamic.

Because Clojure is a functional language, it puts strong emphasis on immutable data types. An immutable data type means data types cannot be changed, unlike many imperative programming languages. When using Clojure, in order to change a data type, an entirely new data item must be made. Immutable data types are practical for novice programmers because immutable data types are useful for avoiding side effects in functions. A side effect is when a function alters memory or interacts outside of its scope instead of returning a value. Side effects can make debugging or resolving errors or failures more difficult. This is because when a function interacts with other functions than itself, when it's not supposed to, any issues in the code can be spread out throughout the program. The reduction of side effects means problems with the code are easier to find and fix.

Clojure, like other Lisp languages, uses prefix notation. This means that function calls use parenthesis, followed by the function name, and then any parameters:
\begin{verbatim}
	(<function name> <parameter 1> <parameter 2>)
\end{verbatim}

Even built-in functions, such as mathematical functions, use this form:
\begin{verbatim}
	(+ 5 5)
	-> 10
\end{verbatim}

Note that \texttt{->} signals the result of the function.
